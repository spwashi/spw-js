# Semantic Operators

`Semantic Operators` clarify meaning. 

Their effects should generally not change much between [`Runtime`](/spw-js/runtime) implementations.

`Semantic Operators` form one of three [`Expressions`](/spw-js/constructs/expressions):
- [`Block Expression`](constructs/expressions/semantic)
- [`Common Expression`](constructs/expressions/semantic)
- [`Phrase Expression`](constructs/expressions/semantic)
