# Constructs

Constructs are divided into three main categories:
- `Nodes` (things)
- `Operators` (forces)
- `Expressions` (circumstances)

## Nodes

`Nodes` are things.

`Nodes` are `Constructs` which, unlike `Operators`, can only `Objectively Modify` `Local` identities within a `Context`. Identities are `Local` when they occur within the same `Node`. `Locality` is `Subjectively Determined` by the `Node Delimiter`.  

### Scalars

A `Scalar` is a thing with one diminesion (its identity).

`Scalars` represent themselves. A thing is a thing.

`Scalars` clarify 'what'.

`Scalar Nodes` are `Nodes` that do not have constituent parts.

When a `Scalar` is first `Evaluated`, an `Entity` is invoked. An `Entity` maintains a reference to the perceived identity of a `Scalar`, as well as its `Conceptual Basis`.

 - `anchor` [`Anchor Nodes`]("/constructs/nodes/scalars/anchors")
 - `123456` [`Number Nodes`]("/constructs/nodes/scalars/number")
 - ``` `#f00` ```  [`Embedment Nodes`]("/constructs/nodes/scalars/embedment")

### Near Scalars

`Near Scalars` are things that are made of other things, and have one objective dimension (their identity).

`Near Scalars` invoke meaning the same way `Scalars` do.

`Near Scalars` clarify 'what'.

`Near Scalars` are `Nodes` that are used like `Scalars`, but are composed of smaller parts.

 - `spick and span` [`Phrase Nodes`]("/constructs/nodes/near-scalars/phrases")
 - `"Near Hawai'i"` [`String Nodes`]("/constructs/nodes/near-scalars/string")

### Containers

`Containers` are things that are made of other things, and have multiple objective dimensions.

`Containers` are more context-dependent than `Scalars` or `Near Scalars`.

`Containers` clarify 'which', 'how', 'where', and 'why'.

`Container Nodes` are composed of a `Scheme`, `Body`, and `Identity`.

- `{}` [`Domain Container`]("/constructs/nodes/containers/domain")
- `[]` [`Essence Container`]("/constructs/nodes/containers/essence")
- `()` [`Location Container`]("/constructs/nodes/containers/location")
- `<>` [`Concept Container`]("/constructs/nodes/containers/concept")

## Operators

`Operators` do things to `Nodes`.

`Operators` are `Constructs` that, unlike `Nodes`, exist to `Objectively Modify` identities within a `Context`, particularly those of their `Operands`. 

`Operators` modify meaning.

`Operators` describe ideas that would otherwise be indescribable.

When an `Operation` is in the same `Location` as its `Operands` (minding `Configuration`), it forms an `Operation` that can be `Evaluated` or `Referenced`. The effects of `Evaluating` an `Operation` are `Subjectively Referenced`.

### Semantic Operators

`Semantic Operators` arrange things.

`Semantic Operators` bind `Nodes` to their `positions` in `Expressions`, often around `Pragmatic Operators`.

`Semantic Operators` moderate meaning.

`Semantic Operators` mutate the `Semantic Context`, which determines how the `Subject Under Evaluation` behaves in `Expressions`.

- `;` [`Block Delimiter`]("/constructs/operators/semantic/block")
- `,` [`Common Delimiter`]("/constructs/operators/semantic/common")
- `â€ƒ` [`Node Delimiter`]("/constructs/operators/semantic/node")

### Pragmatic Operators

`Pragmatic Operators` mutate things.

`Pragmatic Operators` create `Expressions`.

`Pragmatic Operators` define meaning.

`Pragmatic Operators` mutate the perceived identity or composition of the `Subject Under Evaluation`.

 - `+  ` [`Aggregation Operator`]("/constructs/operators/pragmatic/aggregation") - combines the `Channels` of its operands additively
 - `^  ` [`Ascent Operator`]("/constructs/operators/pragmatic/ascent") - refers to a parent context
 - `:  ` [`Binding Operator`]("/constructs/operators/pragmatic/binding") - creates a link/association between its operands
